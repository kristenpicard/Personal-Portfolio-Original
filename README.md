# Personal-Portfolio

Description:

As I learn and grow as a developer, I wanted one place where I could showcase my projects and link to other pages that tell more about who I am.

This page is my first big project using HTML and CSS where I started from scratch and I look forward to improving it over time as well as completing the links once I have them ready.

It was particularly challenging to create a page that is responsive to various screen sizes.  I look forward to continuing to make it even more responsive over time.

I really enjoyed the creative aspect of working with CSS to style the elements and feel that after this project, I have a much deeper understanding of the various capabilities.
